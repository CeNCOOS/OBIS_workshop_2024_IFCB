This is a repository for OBIS 2024 Workshop.  The plan is to take work done by Axiom and Ian Brunjes from previous workshops and create a full workflow to an OBIS ready output.
Code has already been created to generate Event and Occurance tables.  The plan is to supplement these with the EMoF table so that it is ready for submission.
Pre-workshop coding is being done to translate Ian's magnificent work from R to Python.

4) Create module for event table that returns Panda's DataFrame that can be concatenatted to </p>
